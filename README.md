Python-sockets
==============

Socket programming excercises with python!

Client fetches a hosts IP-address with a hostname lookup and creates a socket connection to the hosts port 5555.
Server creates a socket and listens to connections from port 5555, accepts connections with a reply 
and prints out incoming messages.
